### Good morning my precious visitor ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently learning about Java, C++, and Python, attempting to understand their unique features and techniques.
- When not coding, I enjoy binge-watching anime, running, playing football, and listening to music.
- My career goals include pursuing Data Analytics, Software Development, and Web Development.
- In terms of classes, I enjoy Calculus and Physics due to their challenging nature.
